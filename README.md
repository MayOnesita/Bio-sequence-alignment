# Bio-sequence-alignment
Biological sequence alignment program in Haskell

### Requirements


## About the project
This is the final project of Functional Programming subject.
Task: Using Haskell define the data structures, functions, libraries, interfaces necessary to implement the selected algorithm. A program that applies the selected algorithm must be implemented. 
A console interface will be implemented by default, leaving as an optional (extra) the graphic part implemented using OpenGL through the GLUT or GLOSS library.  


Algorithms used:

- Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm
- Smith-Waterman Algorithm
